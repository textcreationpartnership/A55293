         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have found this cauſe between me and my neighbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſaddeſt things that have befallen me ſince God brought me to this place: And of many things deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, this is not the leaſt, that I am forced to a publick vindication for a publick offence, and therein know not how to clear my ſelf without ſhaming an aged diſciple, who is both the wrong-doer and the falſe accuſer. It is not much agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my ſpirit to print upon any thing (eſpecially in this youth of mine) but to print upon this Subject hath been much more againſt my ſpirit then moſt things elſe; not but that the matters are weighty, and greatly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Churches welfare, and the debates of this preſent time, ſo it will be a word ſpoken in ſeaſon; But many others are concerned in it; and who am I, that I ſhould ſtand up as a Champion for the two great Pillars of the Land, Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, in a time of ſhaking, through ſo many fierce contradictions againſt them both? 2. Beſides, this Cauſe is fully pleaded already by ſundry learned &amp; judicious pens, never yet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor ever likely to be anſwered; whereas (as to the matter of Tythes) though many indeed appear againſt the divine right, eſpecially of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea Divines, both Popiſh and Reformed; yet few or none of any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appear againſt the lawfulneſs of them. 3. Becauſe all undertakings of this nature are likely to meet with miſconſtructions enough from thoſe men that know not how not to look aſquint upon any thing we either ſay or do. That charity that thinketh no evil, how is it fled from the earth! it will be thought by many a ſufficient anſwer to all that is brought on the Miniſters behalf, to cry out covetouſneſs; and to all on the Magiſtrates, to cry out perſecution. 4. But then when an unwelcome cauſe muſt be managed after an unwelcome manner, the cauſe not to be handled in <hi>Theſi,</hi> but in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> and that drawing in many perſonal things, and mixing affections with judgements; ſo that we have now to anſwer not Errour onely, but anger, peeviſhneſs, ſelf-will, ſelf-intereſts; and as flowing from them, calumnies, falſe accuſings, unfaithful dealings, &amp;c. Upon theſe thoughts I have been toſſed up and down in my minde, ſometimes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98432:3"/>
ſometimes againſt it, till very neceſſity hath compelled me.</p>
            <p>At the firſt reading of this Book, I thought I might ſafely let it alone, and that it needed no anſwer; but when I underſtood how it was cryed up by that party, and how prized by himſelf, and that this perſwaſion was entered into others (not <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>) that ſome things in it were not to be anſwered; and ſeeing how unlikely it was that any Books, new or old, would ever be looked after by them to remove this prejudice, unleſſe ſome one were brought to their hands from a perſon known to them, and fitted to this Book and Cauſe, in which many things of fact are mixed with the matter of right, which no mans Book could anſwer but mine, and which I have underſtood have and do lie in the way of ſome (though I hope not of many) who have had a greater account of my Miniſtry, till this unhappy debate ſprang up: Theſe things have reſolve'd my former doubtfulneſſe, and produced this Treatiſe here preſented unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tilleſly</hi>'s whole Book againſt <hi>Selden</hi> is of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely.</note>It hath added to my encouragement in this work, to ſee not much time needed in this queſtion, to turn over the writings of Ancients, they to whom I write valuing them not; and that work being done to our hands already by many for their ſakes who do value them, and our Learned Adverſaries of the Divine Right of Tythes acknowledging what is pleaded upon that account, not onely out of the monuments of Heathens, they are ſaid to have done it <hi>aſtutiâ Diaboli;</hi> more probable, I think, what we finde in the famous Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, That the withholding of Tythes was <hi>Inſtinctu Diaboli,</hi> then that the meer paying of Tythes was: Some alſo enquire why the 7th of time among the Heathens ſhould not be as much <hi>aſtutiâ Diaboli,</hi>

               </note> we muſt try out the reſt by Scripture only; for they that will not be preſſed by us with the authority of Fathers, will not (I hope) preſſe us with the Authority of later Popiſh Monks, the <hi>Pontificial</hi> Schoolmen, who are all in this cauſe (and good reaſon why) againſt us.</p>
            <p>Had my neighbour ſpared injurious ſpeeches, and not filled his Book with ſo many unkind calumniations, but kept himſelf cloſe to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of right, I ſhould never have found fault with his omitting the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of matters of fact; But ſeeing he hath ſprinkled his Book all over with ſo much of that unſavoury ſalt, I am forced to let you underſtand thus much, that covetouſneſs is a ſinne that hath deep roots, and is not plucked up many times when we think it is; and when it is ſtubbed up in the main root, it will yet leave many ſmall fibra's behind, which will often be a ſpringing above ground, and require a conſtant hand, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and induſtriouſly imployed in plucking them up; and it would be more worth my neighbors time, now in his old age, among other things, to enquire curiouſly into his own heart about this ſin, rather then ſpend his approaches to the grave in peeviſh quarrellings with, and revilings of his neighbour, who would fain have liv'd at peace with him. Did I take
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98432:3"/>
any joy in recriminations, it were no hard matter to evidence ſore ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of covetouſneſs in him, even in the matter in debate between us. I offer to take half the worth of what was (in my account) due to me, for peace ſake; he offered about half of that which I would have taken; and no man but will ſay he might with as good conſcience have offer'd enough as any thing; a greater proportion then a tenth freely given, would have prevented this ſuſpicion, whereas a much leſs offer'd, and onely to break off the agreement upon the account of the ſum to be paid, does not. I promiſed upon his intreaty to forbear him, if he came in any reaſonable time to pay me, and I kept my word above three years together: He promiſed to compound with me by the pound rent, conſenting to my termes offered, and broke his promiſe, adding contempt to boot, by laying me down twenty ſhillings for three yeares, who had laid me down fourty ſhillings for one year, as he ſaid, becauſe he had promiſed me. I dealt with him fairly and openly, he dealt deceitfully with me; for after he had choſen to compound with me by the yearly rent, liking that better, as he ſaid, then to compound by the Acre, for then he might uſe his Land as he pleaſed, he offer'd to bring me his Leaſe, that I might ſee what rent he paid, whereas it is known there are ſome pounds reſerved of his Rent which are not ſpecified in his Leaſe: I am perſwaded this was never done by his Landlord, my truly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red friend, to abuſe the Miniſter. The goods controverted I am ready to make good my claim to, by that which determines all mens claims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men to things of this nature, the juſt and righteous Laws of the Land; he avoids that tryal, even with contempt, and rebellion after contempt to the lawful commands of the Supream Magiſtrate, as not having any title at all to them that is pleadable in any Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if the Law of God makes them his, I deſire to ſee that Law; ſuch an evidence I hope will ſatisfie Magiſtrates and me too; If he detain them by mans Law, let him plead it; if by Gods Law, let him ſhew it; if by neither,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> .9</note> it plainly appeares he hath no right at all, and I ſhould pray him to detain them no longer; it is ſin: I never doubted the lawfulneſs of receiving Tythes, he never denied the payment of them, or a compoſition for them, to buy his peace, till he had to do with me, whence I ſuppoſe he alwayes held it lawful ſo to do; neither hath he given us one reaſon in his Book why his mind is chang'd. Add that he ſaves his goods, by a deed of gift to his Sons, and ventures his perſon, though a perſon of that moment to ſoules, as an Elder preaching freely to a Congregation baptized many years. What truth there is in this pretence, let his own heart judge; what honeſty there is to convey a mans eſtate, to defraud cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, let others judge; but what piety it is for an Elder of a Church, the freedome of whoſe perſon is of that precious value in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Miniſtry, to ſecure his goods in a conteſt, and venture his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98432:4"/>
perſon, when the debate was about the goods, not about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let the members of his own Congregation judge.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſore ſuſpicions in him, of the ſin I am ſo often charged with, even in this very buſineſs; yet I dare not with all this evidence name him ſo; I know theſe dealings may be referred to other cauſes; of which ſome are not ſo bad as coveteouſneſs, and ſome are worſe: I only ſhould adviſe him to conſider his wayes: Neither dare I whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſe my ſelf from this ſin, though I could ſay much to clear my ſelf in the day of man, and I know this mans accuſations are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof: I hope, grace enabling me, to approve my heart to God, a greater witneſs then man. I ſay no more then this, he is aged; and I, though but in the thirty fourth year of my life, am weak, as being lately pulled back by a powerful hand of God, from the very Brink of an Hectick Feaver, and ſtill in a conſtant inclination thither again: we had need not accuſe one another raſhly;<note place="margin">

I ſay not, the Lord rebuke you, but I ſay, the Lord give you repentance, and make you know that a friendly admonition about the breach of Gods Law is no threatning you, neither before in the eighth, nor now in the ninth Commandement.

No, no, there was no ſuch matter; if ever I ſaw Gods hand in any particular providence all my life, it was in his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand, diſpoſing me for <hi>Staplehurſt,</hi> and bringing me to it; it was Gods work, I am moſt undoubtedly aſſured of it, and not the Devils: had I not ſeen it moſt apparently, I had never ſtaid here; what was done between me and my Predeceſſor, was done before many witneſſes: it was but this: Two Miniſters conſenting to Preach to the ſame people, by conſent likewiſe ſhare the proportion, both of time and maintenance which each ſhould have, that there might be no difference about theſe things afterwards, a thing not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, but in a manner neceſſary, on my part with all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity undertaken and performed, God is witneſs; as for my truely honoured Predeceſſor, his integrity needs not my defence, he is able to do it himſelf in a ſeaſon and manner convenient, if need be.</p>

            <p>For you, my dear Brethren of <hi>Staplehurſt,</hi> my glory and crown, whoſe converſion and building up in the Truth, is of greater ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me then all the Tithe, either of poor or rich, however I am traduced (no ſhame almoſt could have been ſo unhappily hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this) if ever I felt any ſweetneſs and true joy in any thing all my life, it hath been in Gods crowning my labours with ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe even among you, and in the aſſured hope of abundance more, his grace working with me; For you, I ſay, I have this word of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Let not the eſteem of this injurious both ſpeaker and doer, be vile in your eyes; much more let not the name of godlineſs, which he hath for ſo many yeers held out a profeſſion of, be for his ſake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed: Remember how eaſie it is, for raſh and heady perſons, to commit many things which are ſorely to be repented of; and how hard a thing it is for even good men (in whom pride is not throughly mortified) to be willing to ſhame themſelves, by an open confeſſion of open miſcarriages; that you remember what eaſie paſſage there is from the head to the heart, and with what care we are to keep the Devil out of our heads, as we would keep him out of our hearts, and hands, and pens; That you beware of the beginnings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; ſtrife hath no end, no meaſure, no moderation; it cares not how it hitts, ſo by hitting it wounds: Set up an Angel of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for an adverſary, and after we have chaſed about him a while, he will be a Devil in our eye, fancy blinding our judgement, and ſelf-conceit perverting ſtrait reſolutions, that whoever is not in all things on our ſide, is not thought to be on Gods-ſide; and what evil may be in cauſes and perſons, we ſtrongly conceit is; ſo as no evidence of things ſeen and felt can beat us out of it, becauſe we are mightily perſwaded things cannot be otherwiſe then we have conceited them. So our brethren are cloathed in Bear-ſkins, and then worried by us; and as they do in the hunting of noiſom beaſts, that's beſt play which moſt certainly and ſpeedily diſpatches; and this is plain dealing without flattery; and whatever is ſhort of the utmoſt of our power, either in word or action, belongs to our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and mercifulneſs towards our and Gods enemies.</p>

Be jealous over thoſe reaſonings which take you off from Chriſtian fellowſhip; to doe ſoul-good to, and receive ſoul-good from one another, makes any ſociety Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, all the reſt is Heathen; it is a precious Article of our Faith, <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi> Get thoſe evidences of Faith which are the parting duties where the unbeliever walks not with the believer, heavenly-mindedneſs, ſelf-denial, and (thoſe hard duties) the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of revenge even in its loweſt degree, and the love of enemies: doe you more then others for God, as you hope God ſhall do more for you then others.

(an honourable ſimilitude your friends are wont to uſe to ſet forth the authority of thoſe good Lawes, under whoſe protection, next to Gods, you live) Why, neighbour, upon this ground you have acted hitherto, in paying, and preaching, as I am informed, for the payment of them; and is it not ſtrange you ſhould run over this foundation of your former practice, not ſo much as ſpeaking one word of it? My neighbour, ſtay a while, and bethink your ſelfe; what hath carried you off from your former peaceable principle, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and practice? Have you conſidered the Apoſtles rule, That <hi>nothing be done through ſtrife and vain-glory?</hi> Let me put ſome thoughts into your mind. It is not to be imagined that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Succeſſors were ſo unpolitick as to take away the Levites Tythes: Prieſts he muſt have, and they muſt have a maintenance;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98432:8"/>
why not that which was Gods own,<note place="margin">They paid the third yeers Tithe, <hi>Act. 4.5.</hi> why not this too?</note> and which the people had been long accuſtomed to pay? He had no reaſon unneceſſarily to make provoking changes in matters of Religion; and there is no mention of his or their doing any ſuch thing: Doubtleſs this bait to tempt the Lords Prieſts to ſtay and countenance the Schiſm and Idolatry would never be neglected. Now did any Prophet forbid this payment, or any of the Lords people ſcruple it? In the Family of David, inſtance in the long Apoſtacy under <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Amon,</hi> what wicked Kings and Prieſts were then? yet none of Gods people were reſtrained from paying their Tythes. In Chriſts time, when the High-Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was, and for a long time had been bought and ſold, he that would give moſt undermining his fellow, many of them hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sadduces beſides; yet is any relaxation of this duty even then? nay, are they not bound to it by Chriſts own bonds, <hi>theſe ought ye, Mat.</hi> 23.23. In the Apoſtles times not one word to forbid any the payment of Tythes to the Chriſt-forſaking, and Chriſt-forſaken, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, perſecuting Jewiſh Prieſts and Levites. Tythes were paid under Heathens to the Prieſts of Idol-Temples by the then Lawes, no one Apoſtle, Father, Martyr, ever contradicting, and yet they were zealous againſt complyance with Idols too. He that ſhall but read <hi>Tertull. de Idololat.</hi> will find ſtrictneſs enough, if not too much, that way; if <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſtood up ſo fiercely for his craft, not directly oppoſed by the Apoſtles, would not the Idol-Prieſts have ſtood up much more for their Tythes, if the Apoſtle had raiſed queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this thing among them?<note place="margin">

I put this caſe. Tythes are no private mans propriety (I ſpeak of thoſe paid to Miniſters) let the uſer of land divide his own from what is not his own, and carry in what is his, leaving what is not his upon the ground, and then permit him that can bear it out in the Court of men (whether he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98432:9"/>
have a juſt right or no, whether thoſe Lawes are righteous or no) to enter upon the land and carry it away. I ask now what Law of God this Farmer ſins againſt, and whether he doe not his moſt apparent duty? if the Takers title be not good, the Leaver hath none at all, and cannot remedy the badneſs of the Takers title; he is not made a Judge to puniſh an Idolatrous Prieſt, much leſſe is he to mulct the Prieſt, and take the fine to himſelf. Pray think of this queſtion you have overlooked, you make too much haſte: Have you ſtood thus long upon this ground, and doe you now relinquiſh it, without being beaten off with the aſſault of ſo much as one ſlight Argument?</p>

I meet indeed with Chriſts nailing ceremonies to his Croſſe, and Tythe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the reſt, but you ſeem not to mean that Tythes are a ceremony as Tythes, but as a forced maintenance. Frequently you tell us of Tythe chang'd into a free gift, a tenth into any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on determined by the mind of the giver.

I ſee the main weight of your Book is againſt a maintenance ſtinted by the Magiſtrates Authority; and I took notice of it among the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> at the Conference at <hi>Hedcorne;</hi> and this is not done without great and deep advice: They knew, that to ſatisfie ſome mens cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and other mens ſcruples, conſultations had been enter'd upon, to alter the preſent way into ſome other ſuppoſed more commodious and free from contradictions: If therefore they would faſten any thing to the Miniſters diſadvantage, they muſt let goe the debate of Tythes as ſuch, and take better hold; the Magiſtrate hath no power to injoyn any proportion at all; that will doe it; this Principle fits their turn, it ſtrikes home. Agreeable to this was the killing Argument in the Remonſtrance (or Petition) drawn up by them, and intended to be preſented either to the Protector or Parliament, had they ſped in their choice: If they build again what they have deſtroyed, they ſhall be found tranſgreſſors. They had been, and were a deſtroying our Miniſtry as Popiſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian (alas that we ſhould be ſuch eye-ſores to them for reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our people, not only from Popery, but even from Hell!) and they would not build us up by paying any thing to our reliefe (I was

But what think you will become of this publick maintenance? who ſhall have it, the State, or the Landlord, or the Tenant? I have been anſwered to this queſtion with they care not what they did with it, ſo we have none of it: well, and what when all's done? why, there is hope that ſome will joyn with <hi>Spill-hils</hi> Congregation; others with this party, others with another; every one will pull away ſomething, when we are once removed out of the way.</p>
               <p>Think of this ye Rulers, and let this Pamphlet, and others of the like ſtamp, teach you what ſervices you muſt doe for theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can pleaſe them: 'Tis not Tithes they ſtick at; if that would have ſerv'd their turn, I had been free from moleſtation this day. There is no man payes me the tenth of his increaſe, and much ſhort of that would have contented me from this man. This you muſt doe, you muſt make Lawes againſt us, but none for us; that's the ſo much preſſed example of the Primitive Magiſtrates; you muſt be Heathens both wayes, or they are not contented; you muſt take that from us, yea from God <hi>(Conceſſimus Deo)</hi> which you never gave us, and of which you are but Feoffees in truſt for Gods ends, and the ſoules of men, who would not have one of your children left by you Orphans to be ſerv'd ſo; and when you have taken this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, you muſt give us nothing by way of recompence, not ſo much as ſtick up a feather for the gooſe, as the proverb is. Strip us ſtark naked, and turn us out of all, that you may be the abhorring of God and good men for ſo doing, and then theſe giddy Maſters will be pleaſed with you; you may gueſs how long; till they ſhall think fit to levell other mens proprietie as well as ours, and pull down Magiſtracy, after Magiſtrates have, to pleaſe them, pulled down their own greateſt ſupporting Pillar, the Miniſtry. As for me, (though I fear not ſo great a perfidiouſneſſe from our preſent Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, yet who knows what deviliſh Tyrants God may raiſe up in his wrat?) Then I doubt not but the Lord will ſtand by me, and ſtreng- me, and that he will beat down great mountains before me, I ſhall ſee Errour, Divſion and ſin, fall down before Truth, Unity, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: Me thinks I ſee them tumbling down in <hi>Staplehurſt</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and in this confidence, if the Lord hath uſe of my Vaſt Eſtate, for his ſervice, and the good of ſoules, I hope he will give me grace to lay it down at his feet, who gave it all to me, what ever it is: And I know multitudes of my brethren will ſubſcribe this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me, even all that are faithful.

the Apoſtle never took this carnal way to overthrow either Pagan,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</note> or Jewiſh blaſpheming Prieſts, by ſtorming at their maintenance; and I am aſſured it will never thrive with them that doe towards us, who are neither Jewiſh nor Pagan, I hope not in their account neither.</p>

Suppoſe your Separation juſt, then indeed there will be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to maintain that Miniſtry you are duely ſeparated from, out of your own goods; yet there will lie a command of Gods to make another Separation, a Separation of that which is not your own from that which is; and to carry no more into your barn then your own goods,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No need of any ſuch command to be produced. A bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Chriſtian under the Goſpel, and an uncircumciſed Gentile under the Law, hold no proportion to them; firſt you, then yours, is a good order. But for you, you have been related to the body of this people, at leaſt in an implicite covenant, when you joyned with others in calling that faithful, holy, humble Miniſter of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Bigge,</hi> to <hi>Staplehurſt,</hi> and ſubſcribing toward his maintenance, which, among other papers, I have had the peruſal of, I have ſeen;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98432:10"/>
and how you walked with this people in way of ſeeking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, in publick, and in private, your ſelf and others can well remember: Separation imports a former union; you cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in the ſame caſe as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. who would dwell among the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet becauſe you promiſe fair, that upon the diſcovery of ſuch a command you will ſubmit, I ſhall offer you ſomething towards the proof of it. I hope you take the whole Land to be a type, both that which was ſubdued, and that which was unſubdued; and that Tythes were a ceremonial tribute from a ceremonial land; would you not reaſon your ſelf thus? You know that no league was to be made with the inhabitants of the Land; and that the Law for Tithing ran univerſally of the whole Land before they had inherited it, not this part ſhall pay, another not: all was to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and all was to pay. Now put thoſe two Lawes together, <hi>Thou ſhalt utterly deſtroy them, and thou ſhalt duly Tithe all thy increaſe,</hi> and then ſee whether this concluſion follow not, That the Tythe of the whole Land was due to God by Gods own Law; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſuppoſing none ſhould live there but Brethren, Jewes, or Proſelytes; it is therefore of their Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.5. For the execution of this Law, there is no reaſon to expect that, neither is this demanded of me. Neither one Law nor the other was kept, and the Jewes were not alwayes in a condition to keep their own from the hands of ſtrangers: Yet it may be conſiderd, whether the Judges, when ſtrong, would ſerve the Common-wealth of them, and not the Tabernacle; and that King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould make a levie of their perſons for the ſervice of the Temple, and not of their goods. There was doubtleſs as full a right for this, as that. But will you indeed ſubmit upon this Diſcovery? Admit it done, would you not ſay, Though they were then bound, they and the Jewes too, yet now we are freed from that yoke of bondage? you would never doe as you have ſaid; your whole Book drives at ſomething elſe. Again, let me admit that not proved which you call for; what concluſion will you draw hence to help your Cauſe? it muſt be no more then this, Let a profeſſed Pagan come and dwell at <hi>Staplehurſt,</hi> who is, and alwayes was an Infidel, I may not demand Tithes of that man. Is this it you call for ſo eagerly, as if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the whole controverſie were turn'd here? and promiſe ſo peremptorily that this done, you would ſubmit? Fie for ſhame of ſuch heedleſs extravagant ſpeeches; plainly, the clearing of that queſtion neither helps nor hinders; yet if it will do you any good, I think you have ſomething towards it however.</p>
               <p>There is another queſtion, which is more ſlighty touched by the former, the ſuing and impriſoning them that refuſe to pay. I will not ſay you anywhere petemptorily deny it to be lawful in any

               <p>But ſtill, though this will prove the Law to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet it will not prove the Debt to <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> he might be inſpired to give an Alms; and this, though a Law to <hi>Abraham,</hi> would have been no debt of juſtice to <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> goe on therefore, and ſee what is to be found in the Story for this alſo. At firſt ſight it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the King of <hi>Salem</hi> ſhould need an Alms; or if you will not call it ſo, but an Honorary given out of reſpect to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but not due in ſtrict juſtice; yet why ſo great a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? the Tenth of all was a matter of no ſmall value; yea, though we ſhould finde no fault with our Tranſlators rendring the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">

Tenth of all was an high teſtimony of honour; and this no more then give and take, without ſo much as any ſuch ceremony of reſpect as paſſed between two far meaner perſons, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> Sure though <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> dealt like a King in his bread and wine, yet he much forgot himſelf, if this were not a known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon due to his Prieſthood, from others as well as from <hi>Abraham;</hi> this indeed would ſhut out ſuch paſſages of courteſie between them, and, I ſuppoſe, did.</p>
               <p>Pretty fair this from ſo ſhort a ſtory towards the demonſtration of our concluſion, That Tithes were not given by <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi> out of free gift, but as a juſt due and right to <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> Prieſthood.

Now if any can finde an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh payment that is no debt in juſtice; yet the Greek will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be ſo happy as to make any evaſion; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Levi</hi> was tithed, will conſtrain him to acknowledge the debt beyond all hope of eſcape.</p>
               <p>Whether thus much will ſatisfie you, my good Friend and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> gift to <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a juſt payment, and no free-will offering, I cannot tell; but I hope it will; and to that end I ſhall leave it with you.</p>
               <p>But yet our work is not done: The moſt Judicious Adverſaries of the Divine Right of Tithes yield us the Law without all this ado; but differ from us in the determining what Law it is. Joyn we then iſſue with them in this debate.</p>
               <p>The Judicial Law cannot well come in diſpute here; not onely becauſe the thing we ſpeak of is of the things that are between man and God, not between man and man; but eſpecially becauſe <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was none of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoever he was; ſo he and his could not be concern'd in a Judicial Law, but by ſuppoſing Judicials univerſally to binde all mankind; and this is as much Morality as we ſhall deſire to finde, a poſitive Law of Gods, binding other Nations beſides the <hi>Jewes.</hi> If this be granted us, the reſt that we would inferre will quickly follow, and the cauſe is ended.</p>
               <p>But a branch of the Ceremonial Law it may be, as Circumciſion, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſent before to uſher in the whole Body of that Law, as given under <hi>Moſes:</hi> And if ſo, we ſhall finde an expiration for it as for other Ceremonies at the croſs of Chriſt (and I, for my part,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98432:13"/>
if ſo, think ſo too, as to that, or any other Religious uſe, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt himſelf: It were a ſtrange thing to ſee fleſhly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices offered up religiouſly, &amp; men to put the world off with they doe it to other uſes and ends then for which it was done in the Law) it remaines onely, that yielding the conſequent of the ſuppoſition, we demand a proof of the ſo. But here we preſs them too far; it may be, and it is poſſible, muſt ſerve our turnes: And this is all we can have from thoſe that plead onely againſt the Divine Right, and from them that plead againſt the lawfulneſs of Tithes too. Strange! A Law of Gods is produced between us, &amp; confeſſed; only the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of that Law is denied; yet no evidence at all given to prove the temporary nature of it: He that ſayes a known Law of Gods was in the nature of it temporary, had need not onely affirm it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but prove it certain. I take it to be evident they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay here, becauſe where they have been often called upon to ſpeak, and ought by ſuch deep bonds of neceſſitie, yet they ſay nothing. I adde, concerning thoſe learned men that deny no more then the Divine Right, That if this payment to <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> may be truly and properly a branch of the Ceremonial Law, it may be an unlawful payment alſo; and if it be certain it was ſo, it is certainly unlawful alſo: Another man may ſee the congruity of this anſwer to their own ſtating of the queſtion; but truly I cannot.</p>
               <p>So then we proclame a Law found out, they deny it not; we proclame again we finde nothing in the Law why it ſhould not be perpetual; they ſay not they doe, onely it is poſſible that they may; we proclame again, Attempt it, ſhew it, but they are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>Ye we will not leave them; we will try what we can ſay to the Negative <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> that payment of Tithes to <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was not by the force of a Law ceremonial.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a Prieſt of another Order, and not a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Prieſt, elſe he ſhould not be higher then <hi>Levi,</hi> nor for ever; nor ſhould our Lord have been called a Prieſt after this Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>14.19, 20.</hi> in Theſibus Salmur.</note> though I know not what to make of his <hi>Parentheſis</hi> following <hi>(quanquam nec ratio iſta excludenda.)</hi> It is an high preſumption to ſay poſitively that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offer'd any Sacrifice at all, when Scripture ſayes nothing of it: To be ſure, as he is brought in (and ſo he is a type of Chriſt, and ſo he took Tithes) he offered none. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will never finde out a Sacrifice in the Bread and Wine, as buſily as they hunt for it; a reſemblance to our Euchariſt the Fathers indeed have found out, but not a Sacrifice: And in this place we know Scripture ſilence is argumentative; <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98432:13"/>
being a Type, not as he did, or was at other times, but as he is ſtoried to have been, and to have done then: and to this his Tithing doth belong, and to nothing elſe. Adde that we finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Ceremonial in <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> Prieſthood, to be verified a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery by ſome other thing in Chriſt, not in his name, King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, King of peace; not in his Genealogie, without Father, and without Mother, not in the end mentioned of his life and office; not in the work of his Prieſtly office; all theſe were veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt in the Letter; and 'tis wonderful that Tithing alone ſhould be verified in Chriſt by a myſtery, which myſterie I think, is not yet expounded by any, that we may know what it is; much leſs proved and made good.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay that the ceremonialneſs of Tithes, as paid to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> conſiſts not in their reſpective conſideration, as paid to ſuch a Prieſthood, but in the abſolute proper nature o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If men ſay the Tenth as Tenth, is that which is eſſentially cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, it ſhould be ſhewn by what Scripture it is appointed by God ſo to be, that the meer Tenth abſtracted from either Prieſthood, ſhould be in it ſelf deſigned to a ceremonial uſe.</p>

               <p>It remains then a moral Law it muſt be, by force of which this payment was made to <hi>Melchizedek:</hi> yet not ſo moral as that a tenth rather then a ninth or eleventh ſhould be ſufficiently gathered from principles of nature left to it ſelf; numerical reaſons are pretty things for a ſolitary phancy to delight it ſelf with: but the fineneſs of theſe inventions will never engage conſcience to practiſe, eſpecially when the purſes of men are concerned; yet this I will ſay for them, they are as good as thoſe that are brought for the ſeventh of our time: in both which, the aſſigning, what proportion of our time and goods would pleaſe God, the reaſon of man being utterly defective, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding help from a new Superior diſcovery, God hath helped us in both by a poſitive Law, guiding the blindneſs of reaſon, where it did not ſee its way; in matter of time indeed moſt expreſſely, not ſo in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of goods, yet ſufficiently enough, as hath been proved againſt the Defendors of the free will-offering, and is ſuppoſed by thoſe we contend with now: yet if the tenth goods be in this reſpect diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged above the ſeventh time, in that it hath not ſo expreſſe a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive inſtitution, it hath the diſadvantage abundantly made up, in that there is much ſeemingly againſt the morality of the Sabbath in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> whereas there is nothing againſt the morality of a tenth with any colour of ſound reaſon produced, or to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as I doubt not but when I come to thoſe times, with Gods help I ſhall be able to demonſtrate.</p>

               <p>Go on now to <hi>Moſes</hi> time, where the ſtatute Law is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and from whence the greateſt conjectures againſt the morality of Tithes are drawn; yet ſhould we grant them as much as from their reſpect to the Levitical Prieſthood may be concluded an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient tranſient ceremonial uſe; yet this would no way overthrow their firſt right originally, and (for what yet appeares to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) perpetually due to God, and by him conferred upon another Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>Tithes have not their original from the Levitical Prieſthood, for they ran a long courſe before; neither have they their expiration with the Levitical Prieſthood, for they have run a longer courſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98432:15"/>
ſince: while they and the Levitical Prieſthood were in ſociety, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they had to that Prieſthood; but now the ſame they are as they were before, without any reſpect to <hi>Levi</hi> and his ſacrifices at all. This would make ſhort work of the cauſe, &amp; would not be diſproved, but either by ſhowing them not to have had any other Fountain but the Leviticall Prieſthood, which is manifeſtly falſe and diſproved all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; they had a courſe long before, even by Law or that, Jordan like, they are ſwallowed up in the dead Sea of the Levitical Prieſthood, and ought not at leaſt to have appeared above ground ever after; which anſwer hath in part been overthrown, already, when it was ſhown that Tithes are not eſſentially, and in themſelves ceremonial: and ſhall be more fully examined here after when it ſhall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Goſpel hath made no alteration in this matter, nor changed the Law.</p>
               <p>But that I may not be ſaid to paſs ſleightingly over that where the main ſtreſſe of the adverſe cauſe is ſuppoſed to be, I ſhall view more exactly the paſſages which are found in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law about this matter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Laws of paying Tithes, were either ſuch as bound the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Num. 18.18.</note> or ſuch as bound the Levites.

               <p>The Laws of Tithes from the people were of three ſorts: One to Sacrifices and Feaſts, which was Ceremonial: Another to the Poor, Stranger, and Levite, which was Judicial: A third to the Levites, which we ſuppoſe was Moral.</p>

One was to be paid to the Levite where he dwelt, there paid ſure where eaten (I had almoſt ſaid, that all the Antiquaries in the world ſhould never perſwade me to ſo unreaſonable a thing, that from all parts of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Gods people on this ſide, and on that ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> the Huſbandman muſt carry his tith in kind unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that then I know not who ſhould carry it back again to the Levites reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive habitations; the Levites Cities were in all likelyhood the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes for the Fields near them) the other was to be carried to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> One was to be eaten in any place; the other in the place which the Lord ſhall chuſe:<note place="margin">Deut 14.6.

Deut. 14.24.</note> One might not be redeemed, not the Tithe of the Hay, Corne. &amp;c. but by adding a fift part, not of the heard at all; but the tith for the Feaſt might; ſo theſe two were plainly two diſtinct tithings, and both paid by the people every year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98432:15"/>The third years tithing was diſtinct from them both; not all one with the tithing for the Feaſts: for muſt the Feaſts be neglected then? and the Law broken every third year?<note place="margin">Deut. 16.16, 17. &amp; 14.28, 29.16.12.</note> is nor the third years tith to be laid up within thy Gates, and eaten within thy Gates; whereas the tithes for Feaſts were to be carried to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and eaten at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> and why ſhould the third year be called the year of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if no more were done that year then at other times? plainly they are two diſtinct Laws, and muſt have a diſtinct obedience.</p>
               <p>The Tithes for Feaſts were Ceremonial, and were never before, nor ever after; only from the equity upon which they were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, will one Argument among others be brought for our offerings, towards the furniſhing of the Lords Table, though a far leſſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſerve for that uſe; ſo on all hands no ground of this Tithes continuance.</p>
               <p>The third years tithing was Judicial, a Statute for the Poor; and ſo continues in its equitable foundation, that a due proviſion be made by Law for the Poor, whom we have alwayes with us.</p>
               <p>There remains now only that to the Levites to be inquired after, what appearance there is in the Laws about it for us to conclude, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, or againſt the perpetual right of them; the Scripture that contains thoſe Laws, if I have not been ſtrangly overſeen in my Search, are three and no more, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21, 24, 31. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.1. Not many leaves theſe among the Levitical Satutes, though if many leaves had been found of them in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, they would not therefore have been preſently Ceremonial, unleſſe it were proved they were there as branches of the Ceremonial Law, and then one leaf, yea one Verſe would ſerve the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now in none of theſe Scriptures do we find the Original Law, but only reſolutions about the diſpoſal of them, ſuppoſed due to God by a former right, and therefore the ceſſation of theſe Laws and how removed out of the way, will only after this diſpoſal of them, but never overthrow Gods right in them, which they do not conſtitute but ſuppoſe. That in <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.30. tells us, it <hi>is the Lords, it is holy to the Lord;</hi> therefore not to be alienated, Verſe 31, 32, 33. God challengeth his right to them already in being, and the Statute for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids encroachment upon that right; and this is, I think, the firſt time theſe Tithes are mentioned in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law: and here we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to an higher claim, in which if nothing Ceremonial have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, then what ever becomes of theſe Scriptures, Tithes muſt ſtand ſtill, their foundation root being not plucked up, though theſe after-authorities ſhould loſe their binding force.</p>
               <p>What the other two Scriptures determine, is not material to this inquiry, becauſe though they ſhould ſpeak never ſo peremptorily in commanding them, yet they can be only confirmations eſtabliſhing what is on foot already, and ſo muſt follow the Original one; for a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98432:16"/>
thing can be Originally commanded but once: we have found them before in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and there alſo in the current, not in the well-head of them; for that we muſt ſeek higher then <hi>Moſes</hi> if we would find it out, and I am perſwaded, no man can fixe his foot with any certainty of reſolution ſooner then the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p>And yet neither in them have we any Law commanding them from the people; but that ſuppoſed, and upon that the people offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to the Lord (of debt now at this time, it is on all hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on,<note place="margin">Num. 18.21, 29.</note> not of free gift) And God aſſigning them to <hi>Levi</hi> for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Tabernacle, as for <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.1. it is a ſhort ſumme of <hi>Num.</hi> 18. <hi>The Prieſts to eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire,</hi> as in the beginning of <hi>Num.</hi> 18. it is at large declared; <hi>all the Tribe of Levi ſhall eat the Lords inheritance,</hi> as is declared at large, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21.</p>
               <p>There are two rights found in theſe Laws; one from the people to God, and that right is ſuppoſed; the other from God to the Levites, and that right is ſtated,<note place="margin">Num. 18.21.</note> and <hi>de novo</hi> expreſſed here: be it then that <hi>Levis</hi> ſervice of the Tabernacle, for which this aſſignement was made, is ceaſed, and ſo the aſſignement with it, which is the later right; yet we want ſtill the evidence of Gods giving up his right from the people: ſurely it ſhould be ſhown not only where they ceaſe to be <hi>Levis,</hi> but where they ceaſe to be Gods; they come to <hi>Levi</hi> at the ſecond hand, and Gods right is a diſtinct right from <hi>Levis,</hi> was before <hi>Levi's,</hi> and it would be inquired into, how it comes not to be Gods ſince; let the Detainers of Tithes ſhow where God hath relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of this tribute.</p>

               <p>Neither let others object this ſpecial right to be from the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, as who held their Land of God by a peculiar gift, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the wonderful Fruitfulneſs of the Land.

               </p>
               <p>And the ſecond reaſon hath as little weight as the firſt; for admit it all, it will only prove an Obligation to a leſſer proportion, as lands are leſſe in Fruitfulneſs: and what Scripture encouragement can any have to give leſſe then a tenth? If <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Examples oblige us to any thing, it is ſure to much more then a tenth, as I ſhall ſhow anon; what there was therefore of ſpecial Fruitfulneſs in that land above others, had a charge of people anſwering it, yea exceeding it; ſo there was as little to ſpare for the Levite as out of other lands, where the increaſe might be leſſe, and the people fewer indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how few the Levites were, and what Proviſion was made for them in the eight and forty Cities with their Suburbs, and the many wayes that land was otherwiſe charged by God, of which there is ſome taſte given above; reaſon would adviſe, let the Levite be contented with his ſetled Patrimony, wherein he ſareth much better then any of his Brethren, and let him relinquiſh Tithes altogether; but ſo it ſeemed not good in the eye of God, but rather that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſerved him in peculiar ſervices, ſhould have peculiar encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beyond their Brethren, that his houſe may not lye waſt, nor the Levites cry what a wearineſs is it? But why in ſuch a Fruitful land as through Gods bleſſing ours is, ſhould the Fruitfulneſs of <hi>Canaan</hi> be given as a reaſon, why a tenth ſhould not be paid among us as it was among them? God ceaſe our murmurings for the great plenty now for diverſe years afforded us, and make us never grudge God his portion, which we never gave him, elſe we may quickly hear of a Fruitful land turn'd into barrenneſs for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</p>

               <p>It followes that the uſe of Tithes in this aſſignement reſpected
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98432:17"/>
not only a ſervice of a temporary Ceremonial, but of a moral perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature: and though the temporary uſe is now done with, yet the Law will ſtill abide in its principal perpetual uſes, though the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory be vaniſhed; eſpecially when the pains which is taken away by the ceaſing of one, is aboundantly added to the Miniſtes of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in the other.</p>

               <p>I would adviſe him, to conſider what one duty that is moſt moral in his own account did not ſhare in, and ſympathize with the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſpenſation of thoſe times; inſtance in prayer, a moral duty if any; yet turning the body, and lifting up the hand towards the holy land, towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

               <p>So then the right of God in Tithes remains yet firm, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement of them for ſuch uſes remains good, as to the principal uſes; and the ceaſing of the reſt overthrowes not the very aſſignement, much leſſe the Original Law, by which they are due to God.</p>

               <p>The line of the Prieſthood we find altered, but how? by loſing the reward of their Miniſterial ſervice, in caſe of receiving him whom they hitherto had Preached, and being ſent forth by him to teach others to receive him alſo: we want a proof of this: the change was not in loſing any thing they formerly enjoyed; but by taking in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of other Tribes and Nations,<note place="margin">

No reaſonable man, I think, would ſay ſo; that which might have been done then, is done now; and therefore plain it is, that ſo far as the aſſignement goes, we are not excluded from the benefit of it, upon the reaſons forementioned (with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Seldens</hi> good leave) and whoever will pluck Tithes out of our hands, muſt plead an alteration in the Goſpel, ſuppoſed to be made in this matter, and muſt not reſt in any thing barely producible out of this aſſignement to <hi>Levi.</hi> What is added about Tithes, in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is little helpful to the cauſe of them that plead againſt Tithes; being the confirmation of them by the voice of God, and the Edicts of Kings and Governours, of which we ſhall ſpeak in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond plea; we may then draw all that hath been ſaid into theſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary concluſions.</p>

               <p>I ſhall but ſtep aſide, to conſider in brief that queſtion, whether Tithes were not commanded under <hi>Moſes</hi> by a Law Judicial? and then I ſhall follow our Adverſaries in this cauſe, to their pretences for a change in <hi>New Teſtament</hi> times. Our engagement with them that plead the Judicial Law, is not ſo neceſſary, ſeeing to bring in a Judicial Law again, is not to deny Chriſt come in Fleſh; all that would have the Judicial Law rule all, upon this ſuppoſition would yeeld us a Divine right in them; and none but upon the Foundation of equity, upon which Judicials are built, would grant us rather more then leſſe. Yet let it not be injurious to the many great names of them at home and abroad, who are of this perſuaſion, if I propound my doubts, though not very neceſſary to the cauſe in hand. They ſeem to me not to have been due under <hi>Moſes</hi> by a Judicial Law, for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They could not be Judicial, as paid by the people to God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.8.9.</note> whence it is called a robbing of God to detain them, nor yet as they were given by God to <hi>Levi.</hi> Judicials order things from man to man, not from man to God, nor from God to man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Judicials began with <hi>Moſes</hi> politie (ſuch as were meerly ſo) at leaſt with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family becoming a people; for Political Laws ſuppoſe a body Politick to be Governed by them; but no time to be found, wherein Tithes began to be Gods, but the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Judicials (properly ſo taken) concerned the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but Tithes not ſo; it is not to be imagined, that <hi>Abraham</hi> only paid Tithes to <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> he was a Prieſt to many beſides <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from them was this due aſmuch as from him.</p>
               <p>There is but one Politick reaſon, as I know of, given, why the Law for Tithes ſhould be Judicial, and firſt given by the old Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; tis this, that by this means a proportion might be found out for <hi>Levi,</hi> who elſe had no inheritance among his Brethren; no great wonder this from the Schole-men; but that <hi>Rivet</hi> ſhould tell us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other reaſons, this is (the forementioned) <hi>una &amp; praecipua,</hi> is to be wondred at; one and the Chief, and another reaſon named? and this not named once? nay the quite contrary expreſſed? It was not becauſe they had no inheritance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21.</note> therefore they ſhould have

Tithes;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21.</note> but becauſe they had Tithes, therefore they ſhould have no inheritance. I would gladly know what politick reaſon would adviſe the Levites maintenance rather thus, then by giving them a diſtinct ſhare anſwerable to their numbers among their Brethren. And if a maintenance this way were a matter of policie, why ſuch a maintenance as gave a tenth proportion to them who were juſt the 41.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reynolds</hi> on <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110. <hi>p.</hi> 477.</note> part, as ſome compute, ſcarce the 60, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had of the charges and labour of them that occupied the land? Rather one would think upon that politick ground which reſpects the equal proviſion of the Tribes: Tithes ought to have been wholly laid aſide, they having 48 Cities with their Suburbs, about a mile about, ſome of which were Royal Cities; which was a proportion far exceeding any of the other Tribes, conſidering the ſmalneſſe of their numbers. So far is this reaſon from being <hi>praecipua,</hi> the chief, that it is not ſo much as <hi>una,</hi> no reaſon at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be.</p>
               <p>We are now arrived at Goſpel-times; hitherto Tiths are come along with us without any ſtop or contradiction: It is now to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what becomes of them, whether they waxe old now, and are ready to vaniſh, or abide in full force and vertue. I ſhall lay down what I conceive to be the reſolution of the Goſpel in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Miniſters maintenance in theſe following Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note>1. That Goſpel-Miniſters have a maintenance that is due to them of Right, and not of Alms.

But if this, and much more, be enough to ground ſuch a fear; I think juſtly: and this the more, becauſe it is a duty without controverſie; no ſober man debates it; no errour can excuſe the omiſſion of it; a duty eaſily known; we reach it not by a long chain of curious conſequences which may tire a man of an ordinary underſtanding before he can,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98432:19"/>
come at his duty to diſcern it: 'tis as plain as the ſouldiers pay, the huſband mans bread, the ſhepherds fleece, the labourers hire: The neglect of it therefore no ignorance can excuſe, as well as no errour; it muſt lie wholly upon the will; its profaneneſs, or covetouſneſs, or both. Yet if any, meerly out of a careleſſe inadvertency of their duty, have fallen into this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in, I hope upon this joynt admonition, they will be awakened to reform it, and will know from hencforth, that God hath his rent due to him as well as the Landlord; and that the Miniſters right is as much a debt as any mans: So may they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God ſhould look down with a bleſſing on their habitations, as they bring out thence that which is holy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 26.13, 15.</note> as ſomething there is of that nature confeſſed on all hands.</p>
               <p>Further, as Alms was not the appointed maintenance for Goſpel-Miniſters <hi>de jure,</hi> ſo neither was it the maintenance of the Apoſtolick Churches <hi>de facto;</hi> they did not plead the <hi>Jus,</hi> and uſe a meer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.</note> but to the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and if of them his reaſon be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good, that they of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> were not bound in any other duty then meer charity to maintain thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (it ſhould be, not <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is falſely printed) yet I hope he will not ſay ſo of the Miniſter;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27.</note> and even of the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Apoſtle ſeems to mention another debt beſides that of charity. I alwayes took the debtors there to be, not the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as he, but the payers for all it pleaſed them: and do ſo ſtill; neither can it be otherwiſe, the Gentile partaking of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, ought to miniſter to them (the <hi>Jewes</hi>) in their carnal things. To me it ſeemes a contradiction, to affirm a thing due in juſtice, yet paid of Alms; and the foundation <hi>Carleton</hi> lays will not carry home the concluſion; for no man was compelled to give any thing, but every man gave as he was moved: all this is not ſufficient to make an Almes. Suppoſe a Magiſtracy ſo corrupt, that an honeſt man may not by ſuit recover upon a bond lawfully due; yet the Creditor faithfully paying in this bond upon the force of a good conſcience, may not be rightly ſaid to give an Almes: But if any will call this ſo, he may call the other ſo too: Yet I ſhould call both debts of juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6.</note> That this due maintenance ought to ariſe out of all the goods of them that are taught, none excepted; ſo neither the Tenants crop, priviledged by ſinful cuſtomes, or unpriviledged, nor the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans gain, nor the Landlords rent (the tenth increaſe being none of his goods; therefore though ſomething, be given out of the whole increaſe, yet that ſomething is nothing out of the Landlords goods, he muſt give a portion out of his Rent, if he give any thing.) None of theſe exempted; the Apoſtles all goods forbids any thing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98432:20"/>
to be priviledged from this duty, and cancels what is already. This Concluſion alſo we have free from the contradiction of bad princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; could we eaſily free it from the contradiction of bad practices, we ſhould not have ſuch eager neceſſitous ſuing from all parts for Argumentations as we have. I deſire thouſands to conſider how well they acquit themſelves of this plain confeſſed Law of God. I ſay not that theſe things ſhould be done to me; yet a Right it is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the quantity of the proportion which every man is to give out of his goods, is not left to the mind and heart, the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure of him that is to give. This Concluſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to your whole Book, my Friend and Neighbour, and therefore I ſhall purſue it throughly and cloſely. Let me tell you, at the beginning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 18.</note> that the minde and will of the giver is a vile word, a very vile word, and muſt be repented of, though it be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into which your whole Book is reſolved; the free-will offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither determined by God nor man, is no otherwiſe; as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes mans determination, I ſhal deal with it hereafter, as it excludes Gods, I have this place to deal with it in. And firſt I ſhall aſſert my own concluſion, then remove out of the way what you have ſaid in defence of yours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I take this to be a necceſſary inference from the firſt Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if the mind and heart of the giver be the rule determining the ſomething commanded in its proportion; then whatever is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more then a ſmall matter above nothing, is meer Almes: For had we given out of all our goods the worth of a ſingle penny, and had a mind and heart to give no more, we had done what in juſtice we are required, the Law being ſomething, and the rule of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our own mind and heart: The reſt then is meer Alms, a gift of charitie.</p>
               <p n="2">

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note>2. The ſimilitudes Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> uſe in this matter, ſeem to me to import as much: The Labourers hire, and the Souldiers pay are not left to the pleaſure of thoſe they labour and fight for. Yet either is more reaſonable then that Miniſters ſhould be left to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe ſinners whoſe ſins they fight againſt; as ſoon leave the ſouldier for his pay to the pleaſure of the enemy, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for an enemy will love a gallant adverſary; but the more able and faithful Chriſts ſouldier is, the more will the ſinner hate him: I deſire the Gentlemen of the Souldiery to conſider this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Excellency of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſeemes to bear out my Concluſion. God never did yet leave his Miniſters, of what Order ſoever, to the pleaſure of men, how much they would give them: And Chriſts Ordinance is even ſo; that is not (I hope) then commanded; how not commanded? that's a wilde Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

               </p>
               <p>But what need we inſiſt upon theſe things, when we have plain commands determining other proportions, not this. And thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations are either</p>
               <p n="1">1. On the people ſides; not as they have a mind and will, but as they have a power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. or</p>

And this is more then the minde and heart of every giver will afford; many had rather ſee the witneſſes carcaſſes upon the ground, that they may be rid of their Tormentors. 2.

               <p n="5">5. He muſt ſpeak, exhort, rebuke with all authority,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15.</note> and not let any deſpiſe him; which that Miniſter that depends upon the meer pleaſure of his hearers, for the bread he ears, is not like to doe, at leaſt ſhall be in a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Are Goſpel-Miniſtes the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons likely to be neglected by God? or is the grace of the Goſpel become ſo univerſal, as that a Law is now unneceſſary? why not in other things as well? yea why not rather in any thing then in matters of money? Goſpel-grace is not given to take away Laws, but to enable men to keep them: It were a better inference from the greater grace to conclude greater ſtrictneſs of Lawes then greater looſeneſs, as many doe, eſpecially Ancients; yet amiſs that too, but this far worſe.</p>

For my part, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt a wicked Magiſtrate with this, then a wicked people; he would not be Judge in his own cauſe, and might have ſome ſenſe of honour guiding him to a righteous deciſion. Yet if Chriſt had left us to ſuch at people, I durſt now judge Chriſt faithleſſe and ignorant (O what concluſions are there for a ſilly worm to draw from any ſuppoſition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> though never ſo impoſſible!) but I ſhould ſay his wayes were (though wiſe) yet moſt unſearchable and paſt my finding out.</p>
               <p>But a Miniſter ſhall have better entertainment from the godly, yea and ſometimes from the wicked alſo; yet why ſhould Chriſt lay a ſnare in godly peoples way? If the rule now be according to a mans mind and heart, a ſmall matter may ſatisfie that rule; if we jude not ſo wildly, but allow as much as in this concluſion I plead for; yet who ſees not an hundred ſhifts for ſo witty a ſin as covetouſneſs is to elude bounds but generally defined? And are not Gods people liable to covetouſneſs as well as other men? I love not to touch theſe ſores; yet the ſecond concluſion may be inſtance enough well conſidered.</p>
               <p>But admit people willing to their power, and beyond their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98432:26"/>
and in great tenderneſs of ſpirit ſhould enquire what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly muſt come out of their purſes; where might a ſcrupulous conſcience find that in which it may reſt ſatisfied, as having done its duty? How hard is it for a man truly to know what is to his power? what the meer neceſſity of a Miniſter is in general, what of this Miniſter in particular? (We are moſt of us over-modeſt, or over-querulous) we can far eaſier tell the poor mans neceſſity, which is a debt only of charity, then the Miniſters, which is a debt of the ſtricteſt juſtice that can be between man and man, and ſo had need be more ſeverely bounded then then the other; and if conſcience will be at a loſs in judging of the neceſſity; how much more in the honour, and the double honour? Doubtleſs, if God hath not determined this thing, and Magiſtrates may not, theſe two evils will follow: It will be the way to bring Miniſters to the mercy of hard ſtony conſciences, who have no ſenſe of duty, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, honour, or any thing, ſo they may but keep their money: And it wil be the only way to bring tender conſciences to the mercy of Miniſters, as the only ſure way to remove ſcruples.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.16.</note> Take as the ſoul deſireth; it not be eaſie to find any other ground that will by firm, and not ſink under him, without be taking himſelf to Gods pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of old, either as arule, or as an obliging example.</p>
               <p>The very like ſcruples would have aroſe, if the proportion of our time due to God had not been by himſelf determined, and if Goſpel-freedome, and the abundance of grace in it, hath not left one uncertain, why the other? Fallen Nature is more plentifully inſtructed about generals; and the more it drawes to Individuals, the more is it at a loſſe; and yet hither Nature bends, and without it reſts not; for action is not of generals, it needs therefore ſome ſuperiour direction: Now to a man that views things onely with the judgement of reaſon, it would ſeem very ſtrange that God ſhould expreſly determine in Scripture A time, and a maintenance, in which nature can better diſcern what its duty is without any new direction; and yet ſay nothing of How much time, and How much maintenance, the thing Nature is at a loſſe, and needs help in. That for our relief he ſhould determine that which is leaſt ſubject to doubt, and leave that undetermined which is moſt. And what cauſe can any reaſon give why time ſhould be particularly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which will not call for the like in maintenance? Gods will indeed would carry it; but that's in queſtion, and I am now led by example, from the reaſon, to conlud of the will; or rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the will as proved above, and yet to be proved to give the reaſon why.</p>
               <p>It is the ſafety of a willing Chriſtian to have his way plainly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out to him in all things, not to live and obey God at random; I never yet know that Chriſtian that was willing to do his duty, but he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98432:27"/>
was deſirous to knew diſtinctly and particularly what his duty was (as on the other ſide I have known men that have been willing to ſhift off duty, love an uncertain doubtful determination of their duty:) And it may ſeem ſtrange that God ſhould utterly deprive this deſire, which is of his own Spirits putting into them, of all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſatisfaction in this point; eſpecially when in no one thing God hath done the like: The moſt likely inſtance is Almes to the poor; but the caſe is not like, the meaſure of charity being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and that not poſſible to come under a certain rate (as we ſee daily by experience) in general, but more eaſie when it comes to the individual, the poor perſon that is to be relieved: Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſet proportion cannot, need not be determined: Beſides, it would doe much to the overthrowing the very nature of charity, this determination; but Juſtice admits, rather of the two requires ſet bounds. And this Juſtice is capable of them, becauſe it hath for its meaſure honour, which going beyond neceſſity, includes that, and all its ordinary varieties within it, and is not moved up and down with them; which honour having a reſpect to the excellency of the Evangelical ſervice, and that Excellency being a ſtanding Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, it followes that the honour is capable of a ſtanding meaſure, which the poor mans box is not. And if the tender conſcience wiſhes it ſo, and the nature of the thing proclames it may be ſo, and the evidence of fact ſhews it hath been ſo, ſober reaſon may require a cauſe why it ſhould not be ſo ſtill; and finding none, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is ſo.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially conſidering yet further, That whatever ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations may be of the Free-will Offering, that is not at all exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; though maintenance be defined thus, men are left at liberty to goe beyond it: The like here, as in matter of time, Chriſtians may redeem much (and ought) beſides the ſeventh commanded pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>So then we may have a ſtated proportion, and ſo have the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences one way, and yet be at liberty to exceed and goe beyond, as occaſion is, and Chriſtian prudence ſhall direct; and ſo not loſe whatever conveniences may be imagined the other way. And this ſure, ſeeing it pleaſes you Neighbour, for a Cloſe to harp upon this ſtring, would be reaſons reſolution in this thing, if I know what reaſon is.</p>
               <p>Hitherto general bounds and no more; yet ſuch as for ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude mans free-will from fixing its own bounds in this duty: For ſtaid we here, and went no further, all that could be concluded on that way would be but thus much, That God had left the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particulars under theſe generall to the faithfulneſs of men; whatever meaſure it is in particular that anſwers this general, is Gods rule; and the work of diſcretion will be to apprehend aright
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98432:27"/>
what that is, and of conſcience to determine obedience, and of the will to doe it: Here is a latitude to mans judgment and diſcretion indeed (but no comfort in that judgment, being bound to reſolve aright under pain of Gods high diſpleaſure: If God ſay, Let the Elder have double honour; Diſcretion muſt not ſay, This is double honour, when it is not; but what is ſo indeed, it muſt determine; and it were better to have been defined to our hands; much paires would be ſaved by it, and the poſſibility of Errour prevented) But to the Will there is no latitude at all, more then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſee what there is further to be found out towards a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular determination; I adde therefore a Fourth Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is no countenance given in all the Goſpel to a proportion leſſe then a Tenth. We finde no command of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Tenth; and no equitable reaſon will take it lower, either comparing our Miniſtry with theirs under the Law, ſo judging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Excellency; or comparing our Country,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any, with <hi>Canaan</hi> (with due reſpect this to the never dying memory of that famous man of God Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>) for where the Crops are more plentiful, prices commonly are anſwerably low; where leſs plentiful, higher; which will reduce ſuch differences of Lands to an equality, ſo judging upon the account of neceſſity, no equity of taking things lower either way. Neither is there any certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of leſs given by any; and there are certain examples many of more given; the Apoſtles left all;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Luc.</hi> 12.33.</note> and Chriſt commanded the young man to ſell all, and many to ſell what they had, give, and follow. The firſt Jewiſh Believers did ſo; and the withholding but of a part, after it was devoted whole,<note place="margin">

That man that gave ſo little to the ſervice of the Church as a Tenth in thoſe times, was not like to be a faithful ſteward of what God had given him. Though I ſuppoſe the Apoſtles made uſe of much leſſe when they had it for their own ſubſiſtence; and ſo (I hope) doe many of us, where niggardly proviſions do not utterly tie our hands from remitting any thing.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98432:28"/>5. That in caſe a Tenth reach not Gods general meaſure defined, then an higher meaſure is a duty. If you ask how far this higher meaſure muſt reach? even thus far, That they bring not that evill certainly viſibly upon themſelves, which by their contribution they are to remove from their Miniſter: For example, That we doe not deſtroy our own lives to preſerve his; that we leave not our own to certain Almes to prevent his leaving his ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea more, it will ſeem agreeable to Chriſtian duty for men to deny themſelves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conveniences of life, and binde themſelves up into a ſtraiter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe then ſimply were fit, that all hinderances being removed out of the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the Word of the Lord may not be bound, but may run, and be glorified; it being of far more importance to the Goſpel, that ſuch a one be not hindred in the courſe of his motion, then that any private man, at leaſt, ſhould not. And this is no ſtrange reſolution as to the Miniſters meaſure, when the very ſame reſolution we have as to the poor mans meaſure, the loſſe of his life through want of neceſſaries being to be prevented by any thing ſhort of the loſſe of our own and ours: Here therefore much more, ſo far as the Miniſters meaſure goes, it being far more neceſſary that Gods truth and worſhip be upheld in the world, far more beneficial to our ſelves and families to be inſtructed to ſalvation, for Gods eternal and temporal bleſſings both to be beſtowed on us and them, then that we leave great eſtates to our children, to be a ſin to us, in withholding ſacrilegiouſly, where it is due, and a ſnare to them ſoul and body as goods ſo derived commonly prove to be. In caſe therefore of need how dare we give ſo little as a Tenth, when all examples of <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Saints lead us higher? when God hath commanded the double honour, but no where commanded that we ſhould enjoy the nine parts entire and whole to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And who will chide if I turn aſide to weep over the degeneracy of them that call themſelves Chriſtians? How many riotous prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals can finde vaſt ſummes for Gaming, Races, Cock-fightings, gilt Watches, great Buildings, and multitudes of Followers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when nothing can be found by them for the Miniſters of Chriſt, more worth then thouſands of ſuch empty <hi>Kickſhawes,</hi> though perhaps ready to periſh for want? One ſuit of apparel made for one of our gaudy gallants might clothe many a Miniſters family a twelvemoneth, and one of their riotous feaſts might feed ſuch a family another twelvemoneth. Yea when the portion of many wealthy Citizens children ſhall be enough to provide honeſtly for twenty Miniſters children; yet this man will grudge to give twenty ſhillings beyond the cuſtome to ſupply his Miniſters preſent need: Alas, he hath children of his own to provide for. Are theſe men Chriſtians? are they not men that take earth for heaven? Wretched world! Such a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98432:28"/>
grudging at the Tenth, when the firſt Chriſtians thought not all too much to be laid at the Apoſtles feet! The Lord ſoften hard hearts; it is not my own caſe I am ſenſible of; I am better provided for then hundreds of Miniſters that deſerve far better then I; neither do I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my people; I ſcarce know that Faithful Miniſter, whoſe people are, for the generality, more loving to him then mine are to me: moſt of them (ſome few only excepted, and I deſpair not but that love and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will melt them too) deal with me aſwel as I deſire; for I can ſay it truely through Gods grace, I ſeek not theirs but them: 'tis the great cryes and preſſing of Miniſters and people to procure Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath wreſted this from me; I am ſure that could never be if ſome did their duty beyond their power, or but any thing near to their power. And let it not be offenſive to any, if I ſaid thus much on the other ſide; that thoſe Miniſters who have conſiderable Eſtates of their own, and are not ſatisfied with this, and what their places afford them, but by importuning for Augmentations, divert that out of their Brethrens Bellies which is intended to ſupply thoſe that want, are likely to account ſadly one day for what they gain ſo uncharitably to leave their Children Rich: Did Rich Miniſters forbear this preſſing in a time of ſtraites, indeed not of purſes ſo much as of hearts, and Rich people provide honourably for their Miniſters above that ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which devouring Impropriations in many places leave Miniſters to; we ſhould then have the crowding leſſe at the doors of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for Augmentations, and Counſels of uniting Pariſhes laid aſide, rather too great populous Pariſhes divided, or aſſiſtance ſet up in them, that eſpecially in great Congregations we may once be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the primitive Order of having more Teaching elders then one in a place. Do we our duty in this thing, and ſee how long God will ſuffer us to want men; but Pardon begged for this digreſſion, I return.</p>

It is moſt probable that the proportion anſwering thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ends, defined in the 3. concluſion, is ordinarily a tenth; and therefore that ordinarily a tenth is commanded ſtill: he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the general Rule; he hath given the particular preſident; both theſe acknowledged; and who will not ſay, ſhould we adde no more, ſeeing Gods meaſure certainly obtains the general end, and it being uncertain whether mans will or no, that it is fit Gods Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould guide us, only the caſe wherein a larger Proviſion is viſibly neceſſary excepted?

Chriſt demanded not a tenth, therefore he renounced it; the Apoſtles made not uſe of their right, therefore they had none: inconſequent; who ſees not it is ſo? yet to leave no appearance of ſhelter to them from this their laſt refuge, ſee we all diſtinctly.</p>

is of ſmall moment; the oppoſition being not between the weightier matters and Tithe ſimply (would the Learned Man ſay that to pay Tithes ſimply under the Law, was not a weighty thing?) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the weightier things and Tithes of mint, &amp;c. ſo on the other ſide Chriſts <hi>ought</hi> here, is inſufficiently alledged for the morality of them, becauſe at this time all three Laws were ſtanding; ſo this Scripture may be let alone on both ſides.</p>

               <p>I Am now to begin a new Webbe, but that which I hope we ſhall ſee come about ſooner, the power and duty of Magiſtrates to ſee Gods Laws for the maintenance of his Miniſters put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. A queſtion wherein Magiſtrates have many Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but it is a great cauſe of grief to ſee ſome Magiſtrates their own Adverſaries. The grand Adverſary here is the Papiſt, whoſe uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it is that our belief followes the State, and that our Religion is <hi>Parliamentary;</hi> but we can bear with ſuch reproaches; it is more comfortable to ſee a Papiſt raile againſt the truth then trample over it; but that within thoſe walls there ſhould be found ſo many that think Religion an unfit thing to determine of, is a thing greatly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. May <hi>Papiſts</hi> for ever fear the name of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> under what cunning diſguiſe ſoever they dreſſe themſelves, and may <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> never turn their feares into deſpiſings, by making themſelves Vile in their eyes; what are Magiſtrates leſſe under Chriſt in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> then they were in the <hi>Old?</hi> Does not reaſon tell us that the ſcope of Politick Societies is not meerly to live, but to live well? and is there any living well without the Soul be provided for? Hath God declared and done ſo much againſt the Idolatry of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> and do we not yet think, that the care of Gods Worſhip is of main concernment to the temporal welfare of a people? Do ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates think themſelves keepers of ſwine, whoſe care is only that they have Meat and Drink, that they gore not one another, and be not a prey to them that invade them? Have not we Souls to provide a well-being for as well as bodies? What a torture and plague would it be for a man of a Spirit Zealous for Chriſt to be a Magiſtrate, if he muſt have great power put into his hands enabling him to do much, and yet withal his hands bound that he ſhall do nothing? I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God in the meaneſt Office wherein, as ſuch, I may Act for Chriſt, then in the higheſt Office of State wherein, as ſuch, I may do nothing for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But leaving expoſtulations, however moſt juſt, let's ſee upon what principles this power and duty ſtands.</p>
               <p>To begin with the beginning, we find <hi>Adam</hi> a King and Prieſt; <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> a King and a Prieſt; the Prieſthood annexed to the

Primogeniture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.16.</note> which made <hi>Eſau</hi> a profane perſon in ſelling his birth-Right: Regal and Sacerdotal power went together for many ages of the world: All that while their Conſtitutions for the well ordering of Worſhip had the force of binding Laws, if there were any ſuch Conſtitutions, as ſuch there muſt be, God then propagating his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truths through their hands by tradition, not as now by Scripture. I know him that he will Command,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</note> belongs to <hi>Abrahams.</hi> Princely and Paternal power, both in delivering down the Ordinances of Gods Worſhip as Laws to his Children and Servants. And ſure God did not joyn thoſe two Offices in one perſon, but that the Authority of the Prince might winne more awe from the then rude world, then if meaner perſons were employed in the Prieſtly Office. Hitherto the whole power about holy things was in the Princes hand, and this from the beginning; a good Argument that with ſuch Alterations as God was pleaſed to make at ſeveral times, it is to continue to the end; the Magiſtrate hath power in Gods holy things, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was ſo.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8.</note> Not but that the Offices were diſtinct, though the perſon was the ſame, and the Acts ſeveral, and each deriving its fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions immediately from God, but being in one they joyned hands, and mutually ſtrengthned each other by their ſeveral Intereſts; the Prince the Prieſt, by all Actions of a Prince; the Prieſt the Prince by all Actions of a Prieſt; ſo it ſhould be now they are in ſeveral hands, and there is need both wayes; we need not inquire which way moſt, though it be eaſy to gueſſe: So it was then, and it is moſt unnatural to think it otherwiſe; every Authority will do it utmoſt to preſerve it ſelf.</p>
               <p>So they run in one Stream till they came to <hi>Moſes;</hi> then they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide; and what is parted with at that diviſion? So much will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to other ſhoulders, the reſt abiding where it was; the time, and manner of doing, this is found, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. where we find <hi>Moſes</hi> the Magiſtrate executing the whole Prieſtly Office in the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, which Act was done by him as a Magiſtrate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel as a Prophet; for then the Magiſtrate deveſted himſelf of that power, which had reſted upon him from the beginning of the world till now, and communicating to another Order, the Government as to both duties growing now too heavy to reſt in one hand through the multitude of thoſe that were governed, and the variety of Laws they were governed by; and what is now parted with? The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Prieſts function in all the duties of that place; the intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power of that holy miniſtration, but no more: the extrinſecal power of ordering both the people and his Sons in matter of Worſhip, commanding all to do their reſpective duties, tithing, encouraging, &amp;c.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>ere meerly Prophetical; and that the Princely power did not at all put forth it ſelf in them, he will ſay ſo gratis and without proof; it appeares no more was deveſted; the reſt then was retained; and when we ſee it put forth, why ſhould we doubt whither to referre it? <hi>Moſes</hi> Prophetical Spirit was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to direct about what God had already revealed, but about what was further to be received from God: But this was a power anciently communicated, long uſed; yea in new injunctions from God the receiving and communicating them were Actions of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Prophetical: but the binding people to the obſervance of them by a legal eſtabliſhment, is the Action of the Office Princely, and its legiſlative power had by <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed after a manner extraordinary; but belonging to that power, however Lawfully had and held of God. And this difference is altogether the ſame in the Laws againſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Adultery; Moſes otherwiſe forbids them as a Prophet, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as a Prince; and although my Neighbour unadviſedly limit ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws to things indifferent,<note place="margin">

               <p>And this reſerved power of <hi>Moſes</hi> does yet further appear a certain and perpetual branch of his Princely Government, in that all ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Magiſtrates after him, Judges and Kings had it and uſed it; both thoſe that were Prophetically inſpired, and thoſe that were not: the good ones to eſtabliſh good things for the Houſe of the Lord; the evil ones to neglect Gods Houſe, and draw people to Idolatry: the Prieſts never medling with this matter; none but <hi>Jehoida</hi> appearing upon this Stage; and he in a time of great diſtreſſe, as by right his wife next of kindred to the crown, the ſeed Royal being all deſtroyed in the Kings Minority, as <hi>Guardian,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It does diſhonour Chriſt in his prerogative, whoſe royalty it is to prepare for his Miniſters. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> To prepare you mean food &amp; ſubſiſtence for them, among many other things Chriſt prepares for his Miniſters, that indeed is one; and we bleſſe him for his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preparing; he hath done according to his promiſe, by ſtirring up the hearts of Princes and people to contribute; and then by ſtirring up Magiſtrates, his Servants on earth, to eſtabliſh and ſecure as Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Feoffees,</hi> what is ſo contributed to the uſe of the Goſpel; and we believe it is Chriſts prerogative Royal, to chaſtiſe them that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from his Miniſters the Meat which he hath thus prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Will this ſerve your turn? No; it muſt be another exerciſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, by which he is ſuppoſed to prepare for his Miniſters, only by ſtirring up peoples hearts, without any eſtabliſhment of mans; but does that Scripture prove ſuch a thing? or any Scripture? or reaſon? or experience? or any thing? I have thought it the ſafeſt way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand promiſes in the ſame ſenſe, wherein we have ſeen them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; and we have found in all ages Miniſters provided for, ſome this way, ſome another way; ſome in part this way,<note place="margin">

It ſhould therefore be demonſtrated, that Chriſt hath reſerved this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yalty to himſelf ſolely and only, and that he will have no Inſtruments ſo ſerve in it under him: but why is this matter of money ſo ſacred a thing that none but Chriſt may touch? hath he not committed greater matters then this to Inſtruments under him? Surely the matter is leſſe in the eye of Chriſt, then it is in the eye of man; <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loves that the buſineſs of the purſe ſhould be heard only by the hearing of Chriſt; let him ſcape till then, he will venture that: but let it not be ſo with you my Neighbour; I would have you more afraid of the hearing of Chriſt alone then ſo, and not to count it a deſirable priviledge, that your purſe matters may be reſerved to that dayes Tryal; pray does Chriſt work upon the hearts of people to regeneration mediately? and is the parting with a little money ſo choiſe a buſineſs, that this alone he ſhould work immediately? why? ſuch a ſole immediate prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would exclude Church diſcipline, from meddling in this matter aſwell as civil Laws; yea, and the Miniſters Authority comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it in his place aſwell as the Magiſtrate in his; if thoſe two wayes be admitted, then tis not altogether immediately, and it will reſt to ſhow how the interpoſing of Magiſtrates under, and for Chriſt, in the executions of his commands, does more entrench upon the Soveraign Royalty of Chriſt, then the enterpoſing of a Church or Miniſter: if any ſay, theſe do it by Chriſts Authority, Magiſtrates not ſo; this is to beg the queſtion, and the meer Royalty of Chriſt here alledged, will not conclude it againſt us; we muſt ſee what is further ſaid for that.</p>

the particular determination, whether by private devotion, or by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sanction, is not holy as ſuch; only as it is the execution of a Law in general about maintenance, and as it now reſpects an holy uſe; both which were not in it before the conſecration; elſe that would not be arbitrary; this then is civil, and therefore by force of this Argument belongs to the Magiſtrate;<note place="margin">

The Apoſtles gave us no ſuch Example: true; the then Magiſtrates were not in a caſe to relieve them; and the then Chriſtians needed no complaints of that nature to be made againſt them: or if any did as the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> a ſupply was made elſewhere as to him from the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> though they were apt to create a jealouſy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he loved them or no, from whom he would receive nothing, which he prevents and removes; any of theſe will anſwer as ſtrong an Argument as this is. There are many that are ſo happy as never to need a Magiſtrate for the recovery of any debt whatſoever (the

Chriſt gave no ſuch precept to ſue for any debt, therefore not lawful: what think you? It is enough that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates have a precept from Chriſt to execute Judgment; and though all men ought to make uſe of Magiſtrates Authority with much tenderneſſe, as their laſt refuge, and Miniſters eſpecially above others: yet when there is no remedy, the wrong cannot be ſuffered under, and no mediation will ſerve the turn; it is then a liberty for them, and, as the caſe may be, a Duty, to make uſe of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt; and Miniſters are not the onely perſons cut ſhort of the benefit of this common relief; if we are, ſhew where: I think we lie under a peculiar duty above others, in as much as what Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we loſe, we loſe not to our children, but to ſucceeding Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and in them to the Church of God for ever.

The truth is, I foreſaw no ſuch conſequence at all, much leſſe was I afraid of it, neither doe I yet, though you have told me it: For, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a Law, might not a man have gifts and grace from God for the work of the Miniſtry, might he not be ſtirred up to the work? might he not be invited to a people deſtitute of help, and accept of the invitation? Might he not be ordained to the Office of a Miniſter of Chriſt by Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er and Faſting with the laying on the hands of the Preſbytery? Might he not act in this Office as Gods Embaſſador, Teaching, Exhorting, Commanding, Reproving, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, exerciſe all that belongs to him in the whole power of the Keyes, by binding and looſing all in Gods name, and in Chriſts ſtead? Might he not be ſtill employed in bringing men from the power of Satan unto God, and in edifying thoſe that have been already cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Have not thouſands been ſo ſince theſe Lawes have been in the world? Might they not receive all their encouragements from Chriſt, even this of faithful Magiſtrates under Chriſt, encouraging him in the work, as they commanded him to doe his duty in the work? How will this one thing daſh all, he hath his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from Chriſt by the hands of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who ſhould have had it from Chriſt by the hands of Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
               <p>But if this be to be Miniſters of men, to be under the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate; to be commanded by them to doe our duty; to be liable to puniſhment from them in caſe we neglect our duty; to be encouraged by them in our faithfulneſſe to our duty; We own our ſelves Miniſters of men in ſuch ſenſes, and hope to be found the rather Miniſters of Chriſt for ſo doing: And we do withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſelves bound thankfully to acknowledge all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we receive from the Magiſtrates protection; to pray for them, and contribute our utmoſt endeavours to maintain their juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they have from God againſt all heady ſeditious Principles in matters of State, as they are bound to maintain that juſt Authority which we have from God againſt the like heady principles in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. And we ſee, men would not believe it ſooner; they that are giddy one way, are like enough to be ſoon giddy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way too. And when both doe our duties towards each other, we ſhall give Papiſts and Atheiſts (that I include not you) leave to mock on with ſuch jeers as this, or, which they pleaſe, to gnaſh their teeth.</p>
               <p>I ſay no more to this buſineſſe then thus much, That Miniſters and Subjects are the ſame perſons, though under different Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in the duties that belong to each agreeing very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98432:41"/>
and no good ſubject can from the ſuppoſition of the one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the denial of the other.

Well fare your heart how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when you acknowledge that the ſtamp of the Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er added to indifferent things, makes them neceſſary. But hath the Magiſtrate no power to ſet the ſtamp of his Authority upon things neceſſary? Are all things that come within his reach ſuch as may be done or left undone, till he make Lawes about them? I had thought that the great work of the Judicial Lawes was to be a fence about the Moral; and that the main work of Magiſtrates was <hi>To be a terrour to evil doers, and to be for the praiſe of them that doe well;</hi> the Rule of which doing well or ill is the Law of God.

               <p>And that will further appear, if we take notice that this very foul miſtake does moſt dangerouſly wound that very cauſe for which it is aſſerted. For, is it not your Doctrine, That the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate proportion of what is to be paid to Miniſters, is nowhere commanded by God: if ſo, then though a maintenance is due, yet this, or that proportion is indifferent; may be done, or left undone, and another choſen. Will not now the reſolution of this <hi>quota pars</hi> according to your very rule, belong to the Magiſtrate, as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? The Conſequence then to be heeded, will not be, if Magiſtrates pleaſe, Chriſts Miniſters ſhall have a maintenance; and if they ſo pleaſe, they ſhall have none: But if Magiſtrates pleaſe, they ſhall have this maintenanance in particular; or, if this pleaſe not, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the determination of which indifferent thing (ſuppoſing it ſo to be) ſome men think will better become a faithful upright Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, then the very beſt of our people, who are the perſons muſt pay what is ſo determined.

               <p>Adde as the Cloſe of all, that whereas 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. are chiefly alledged againſt a conſtrained maintenance by the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority; they doe directly belong to proviſions for the poor, onely by conſequence, if at all (of that above) proviſions for Miniſters. Now if the Magiſtrate determine any thing, as to us

whom the places concern not but by conſequence, you obey not: whereas if the Magiſtrate determine any thing, as to the poore, of whom the places alledged ſpeak directly, you reſiſt not, ſo far as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I heard, none of you. Now what perverſneſs is this? Conſider your wayes.</p>
               <p>I have with moſt punctual exactneſſe conſidered all that hath the leaſt ſhew of a reaſon againſt the Power and Duty of the Civil Magiſtrate. The Lord help you to a clear underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to diſcern the exceeding emptineſs and inſufficiency of them; and to an humble heart, that you may be willing, upon ſo plain and full a diſcovery, to lay aſide your Errour.

               <p>As a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall adde ſome general Anſwers to other mens Exceptions againſt the Magiſtrates making Laws in matters of Religion; and then I ſhall have done with the ſecond Plea.</p>
               <p>The firſt Pretence is the difficulty of defining to the Magiſtrate his due bounds in ſuch matters: All yield ſome infirmities of mind, as to the belief of Truth allowable, as well as ſome infirmities of heart, as to the practice of Duty: And where ſhall we ſet the bounds? why ſuch a difficulty now more then under the <hi>Old Teſtament?</hi> Hath Chriſt given us the Goſpel to obſcure the Truths of God, or to make them more illuſtrious?

Should I hear of an Act of Toleration to but an officious lye, I ſhould think it an evil greatly to be lamented; yet I would not have every ſuch a one haled to the tribunal of publick Juſtice for it.

We cannot by law change a ſinners heart; but we may change his place by Law: Our Our Brethren in <hi>New-England</hi> can baniſh them whom they cannot reclaim. We cannot by Law change mens hearts; yet we may by Law encourage them who by Chriſt are imployed for that very purpoſe, and remove from them thoſe that ſeduce and pervert them; and this will go very far towards the changing of their hearts. If conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be a thing that cannot be forced; why fear we making Laws about it? If Lawes are good, they may direct, warn, draw a bad conſcience; and it were not much harm if they could force it: better is a forced good, then a free evil: If Lawes are bad, what fear we? they may diſcover a bad conſcience, but they cannot force the good.</p>

be ſpared now, that hereafter if ungracious Magiſtrates be ſet up in wrath, Gods people may be ſpared under them?

Nay let us enlarge the politick counſel too: If Parents and Maſters that are godly, ſhould ſuffer ſin in their children and ſervants, in hopes that the many Parents and Maſters that are wicked, will doe the like to their children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that are godly: would it not be deep deſigne too? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the good Parents and Maſters being ſo few, and the bad ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? What care doe men take ſincere Chriſtians may never feel the Croſſe! Yet that was one of Chriſts Legacies to his; it was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles glory, is that to which all they that will live godly are appointed: and the firſt Chriſtians counted them happy that endured; but with us, how effeminate, and worldly, and ambitious a thing is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion grown to be! Grace ſhal ſpare ſin, that ſin hereafter may ſpare grace: Have we this league within us too? or are we ſure ſin will ſtand to the terms? never look that wicked ones will deale ſo gently with the good conſcience as we expect they ſhould. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts never yet gave us any ſuch inſtances to hope ſo; and if the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be not yet ſlain by them (and far wiſer men then I think they are not) there is a ſea of blood more to be added to what is under the Whores ſkirts already: Pray how long is it ſince the Lion turned Lamb? Blood is an eſſential ingredient in the Religion of a Papiſt; and let thoſe who have received the moſt deadly principles that Popery hath in the Doctrinal part of it already, adde but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion of Popery; yea, let them but hold the ſame things with other names, and go on with their ſerpents, vipers, filthy beaſts, dogs, and ſuch names as theſe innocent meek ones pleaſe to give us, the Magiſtrate in the mean time clapping all ſides on the back, only holding a ſword between them to keep them aſunder; and who can expect but theſe two Seas ſhould in time meet in one? and that then words ſhould be turned to blowes, and we dealt with as thoſe noyſome creatures we are likened to are wont to be? This they would doe, becoming Papiſts, though they were meeker then they are: turn the lamb into a wolf, and it wil devour fleſh, though it do not now: And if we tolerate not the name of Popery, it will be ſmally to our relief, if we tolerate the thing; names ſhed no blood. Look to it therefore ye Magiſtrates ſupream and ſubordinate; drive away thoſe blood-ſucking Leeches out of the Nation, under what favour'd diſguiſe ſoever you finde them. Let not thoſe frogs of Egypt creep into your Life-guard and Bed-chamber.

Is it not as likely that Chriſts blood ſhould be ſhed for theſe, as for blaſphemy againſt his own perſon? Theſe are ſad reaſonings from men of wiſedome; the Lord in mercy anſwer them, that men may once learn the truth of ſuch maxims as theſe, That it is mans greateſt ſlavery to be free to ſin. That gevernment is in vain appointed, if men may doe and ſpeak what they pleaſe under it. That there is a great difference between execution of juſtice, and perſecution. That Chriſts blood was ſhed to make us free to good, not free to evil. That Chriſtianity diminiſhes not the juſt rights of any lawful Superiour, nor frees any from a due ſubjection to the powers over them; as it finds in thoſe things, ſo it leaves: Saints muſt be ſubject, as well as other men. That though God alone make Lawes to binde mens conſciences, yet men may guide mens conſciences to the obedience of thoſe Lawes, and puniſh the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying perſon, though they meddle not with his conſcience. That it will be no plea allowed at the day of God, in matters of ſin, to ſay, <hi>It was my Conſcience:</hi> And if it will not excuſe the ſinner from Hell, he ſhould not have had ſuch a conſcience; much leſs ought it to be a plea in the day of man, where the penalty is of a lower narure. That it is far better to ſuffer for doing well, then not to be reſtrained from doing ill. That Magiſtrates ſhould have conſciences as well as ſubjects; and if it be according to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be a terrour to evil doers (I am ſure it ſhould be) why may not they plead this freedome of conſcience upon the ſame ground as evil doers plead it, that they may goe unpuniſhed? If Magiſtrates omit a known duty, they wound their conſcience; if the evil doer (ſuppoſe the well doer) ſuffer under the miſtake of Magiſtrates, his conſcience is not preſently wounded here: who then ſhould rather of the two be provided for? That a Liberty to obey God without fear of man, is a choiſe mercy, not ſo a liberty to diſobey God. That

That it is a more fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God, then of a mortal man; and that if we did judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.

               <p>But we are as much Hereticks in their eyes, as they are in ours: It appears ſo indeed by the language they vouchſafe us.

               <p>But ſuch things are contrary to the light of nature; things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak, are only contrary to revealed light, the light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

For others, 'tis much that the gatherer of ſticks on the Sabbath day could not finde out this diſtinction to ſave himſelf from ſtoning with. Have we not as good evidences for the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>-doctrine, as they had for the old? The Doctrine of the Goſpel is revealed ſufficiently to damn them that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; and may not men be puniſhed on earth for blaſpheming it, for want of a ſufficient Revelation? Take heed, do not make God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance. It is as hard a matter to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that Law of Nature, No woman but one, that it is of God, as it is to be aſſured of that Law of Scripture, No Mediatour but one, that this is of God. Let any man compare the Evidences for both, and he will quickly ſee this is truth; and yet the adultery of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two wives is juſtly puniſhed with death.

                     <hi>P.</hi> 10.</note> This may be then; and if it be, you muſt reſign, your ſelf hath ſaid it: Now what have you done to quiet Conſcience in not reſigning? have you conſulted with thoſe Records which might give light about ſuch ancient things? Have you enquir'd of one able Lawyer, to know the truth of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Right? Shew me one among ſo many friends and adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that will give it under his hand, that the pretended Donation of Tithes in <hi>England</hi> is a meer forgery, a <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> Donation: Oh Neighbour, ſurely conſcience hath been much aſleep, if you can withhold a payment due upon the ſuppoſition of ſuch a gift, by your own confeſſion, without ſo much as once examining whether there were ſuch a gift or no. Is it poſſible that a tender conſcience ſhould not tremble to keep goods in his hands, which for ought he knowes, belong to another man, is, or may be ſure they belong not to him, and that with ſo much eagerneſs of contention? I hope you are not altogether without ſuch motions of fear; I would not have you paſt feeling.</p>
               <p>But it concerns me to prove ſuch a gift who claim by it.

And muſt Miniſters be put to that which no man elſe is? are we perſons uncapable of common Juſtice, the benefit of that which a Turk having poſſeſſions here might enjoy? are we wilde beaſts, that may be deſtroyed any how, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas?</hi> Surely others will count it enough to juſtifie a Title long enjoyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing may be alledged by any man to the contrary: yea, and others will provide they bring their plea within the memory of man; otherwiſe they expect it ſhould not be admitted at all; no man being ſuppoſed to be ſo long negligent in his own matters, if he be, <hi>currit lex contra negligentem;</hi> and there muſt be an end of ſtrife. But ſo ſhall not I deal with you; do you ſhew how a Right to the goods

queſtioned, hath deſcended to you by any Lawful meant, from any perſon whoſoever the owner of <hi>Spillſhill</hi> farme, either within, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the memory of man: and if I do not prove mine a better Title, I will give over my right.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Landlord, altogether unacquainted with the Lawes of the Land, cannot at all prove his Title to his goods or land he holds, muſt he therefore forfeit them to him that uſes the land, who hath no title at all to them? Examining old deeds of gift belongs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profeſſion, not to yours and mine. How many deeds of gift were never enter'd upon Record? how many Records are worn away by the injury of time, or conſumed by ſeveral caſualties? May we not verily believe that to be true, which is verily affirmed by all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, friends and enemies, and that in a matter of fact, without further enquiry? I know no man that ever denied that ſuch Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been, no not thoſe thoſe that prefeſſedly write againſt them.</p>
               <p>Me thinks in a buſineſs that belongs to another calling, it might be a fair Argument to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing done, when we ſee things that are not likely to have come to paſs otherwiſe. Imagine the thing to be done now, if one or two might be gull'd, or forced, might al men be cheated out of ſo conſiderable a part of their eſtates, let it go they know not how? or if this generation could be ſo ſtupid, would the next be in ſo deep a ſleep too? ſo univerſal a violence upon that which our Forefathers were as tender of as we, their eſtates, paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in ſilence ages after ages, no man among the many thouſand co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſons, haters of God, his Word, and the Miniſtry of it to this day not opening his mouth to the contrary: eſpecially when we finde ſuch tugging about the manner of enjoying theſe deeds of gift, as about wood-land, new-broke ground, &amp;c. They that had courage enough to queſtion the manner, would they not much more have queſtioned the thing, if any juſt cauſe had been found? Leſſe matters then this would ſatisfie me that the thing was done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as their own act and deed; I know not what will you.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall try a little further. Donations are either publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; we have both, if both will ſerve.

If the Rent-charge you are bound to ſhould be a 9, or 8. you would count ſo much leſs given you, as the Rent-charge is increaſed; if he ſhould ſet the Rent-charge higher then the land is worth, ſo much as when it is paid, there will not remain enough to pay the uſer for his paines; then I ſuppoſe you would intreat your Landlord to keep his gifts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be contented to be his Tenant ſtill. This would not be to make you a ſlave; for here would be no violence; if you did not like his gift, you might let it alone: you know how to apply.

Did not the Chriſtian world groan under the burden of Popiſh tyranny, and cry out for a free General Council, or any effectual meanes of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? do not al our Writers againſt <hi>Rome</hi> prove by ſenſible demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that Poperie that now is, was but a Faction in the Church, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their innovations, now one, then another, till they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into that body they are now in by the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> yea, it was poſſible, that errours creeping in by degrees, and not impoſed upon any of neceſſitie, ſhould at once carry away all like a floud before them, no man opening his mouth, nor ſo much as believing to the contrary: where was the voice of the true Shepherd then? could <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> ruſh in ſo upon us in the Biſhops times, or can it now as it is brought in again at the back door by Sectaries? yea, do not all know what moderation there was in many of the <hi>Trent</hi>-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and how many of them were ſent away in diſgrace, all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the violence of the Romiſh partie: If al was Popiſh, what need the Pope fear ſo much a General Council as he did? what need that packing &amp; ſhuffling as was in <hi>Trent?</hi> why ſo many <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, many of them titular ones, thruſt in, ſo much exceeding thoſe from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they might over-ballance all good motions by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? what need things be ſo ſtrangely carried there, that their own friends cried ſhame of it, and the <hi>French</hi> Nation for a long time reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it as an unlawful Council? and yet this a Conventicle pack'd for the nonce to carry on the Popiſh cauſe, otherwiſe great fear leſt their cake ſhould have proved dough too. Nay when many, I know not but all, of our Divines doubt not but God hath his company in the midſt of Poperie at this day, now that ſo conſiderable Bodies of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are departed from them, and they as evil men &amp; ſeducers are wont to do, wax worſe and worſe; and they think <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. leads them plainly to be of that minde: yet this man makes no bones of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding concerning the former much better times of Romiſh communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all was Popiſh then. Not likely ſuch conſiderable bodies ſhould have fallen off from them at the time of Reformation; and no doubt of them that ſhook their heads at the Romiſh abominations, yet durſt not depart from that Communion, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was not the man only neither. I have found perverſe men ready to ſay any thing rather then let go an errour they have once eſpouſed: Let it not be ſo with you, Neighbour, I am aſſured you wrote this inconſiderately,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98432:49"/>
raſhly, and headily, as you have many things in this Book beſides. It is certainly untrue, and moſt diſhonourable to our common Faith; no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt but will be glad of ſuch a conceſſion; and no Proteſtant, I think, knowing or ignorant, ever yielded it but you. Let it go for ſhame, and let no more ſuch frantick Aſſertions fall from you.</p>
               <p>That the Acts and Monuments fetch all their ground for Tithes out of the Moſaical Law, does not appear to me: I finde little diſputed for tithes; and two Martyrs, <hi>Walt. Brate</hi> in <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. time, and <hi>William Thorp</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 4. time, diſputing againſt it; the former againſt the neceſſitie of them, the later againſt the lawfulneſs: in both little is ſaid in their behalf, only one word from the Arch-Biſhop to <hi>Thorp</hi> is of any weight, <hi>Thou wouldſt hereby make the Old Law more free and perfect then the New Law, and this is a New-Teſtament Argument.</hi> I finde alſo King <hi>Ethelſtanes</hi> gift there Recorded, and for it alledged <hi>Jacobs</hi> vow, a place in <hi>Matth.</hi> and a ſentence much uſed by the Fathers, <hi>If thou withhold from God the tenth, he will withhold from thee the other nine:</hi> or to that purpoſe. But the Moſaical Law I finde not urged by any, much leſs that only. Other things are ſaid, that not at all; yet I may be deceived, ſomething may eſcape my haſtie ſearch, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps finde that ground elſewhere; yet that ground is not all, if anywhere at all; herein your relation muſt be blamed. So when it is ſaid a King at his death-bed gave to the Prieſts that then were; I cannot certainly ſay no; yet I doubt this is not ſo, they were wont to give to God and the Church, and that it was out of a Popiſh perſwaſion that they were due by the Law of God. I want your proof for the fact; you did ill you ſet it not down.</p>
               <p>For the Charter of <hi>England,</hi> it onely confirms the Rights and Liberties that were then known and had, of which Tithes at that time were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted part, but expreſſes not them, nor any ground of them; much leſs was the Moſaical Law the ground, and all the ground. What meant you to affirm an untruth, where it is ſo eaſie to find you out? The Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-table of <hi>England</hi> is a Book I never ſaw; and you have not ſeen this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, that in it the Moſaical Law ſhould be the only ground, is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if it ſhould prove true, either you have a very good memorie, or write at random, true or falſe at a venture.</p>
               <p>But be this ſo, they pleaded the Moſaical, and that onely; yet all the Moſaical Law is not Ceremonial; Tithes may be morally due out of the Moſaical Law: and if ſo, for what you have demonſtrated to the contrary, this may have pleaded right. But that we have done with; ſuppoſe the ground of the Plea (whatever it was) to be naught; yet it follows not that the obeyers of that Councel acted upon thoſe grounds: I have not found any certain evidence of ſuch a thing; and the Lawes about Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c. the prevailing cuſtomes in ſo many places about the manner of Tithing, cutting the Miniſter ſhort of a preciſe Tenth, are evidences that the Divine Right of Tithes was not ſo much regarded by the Donors and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmers of them.</p>
               <p>Yet again admit Prieſts ſo pleaded for them, and people ſo gave them; will the Donation therefore fall to the ground? frame it then into a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule. All thoſe deeds of gift which are granted upon a miſtaken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98432:50"/>
are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void and of no force. Do you not ſee this a manifeſt untruth? power to give, and power to receive, will make conveyances va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, be the principles moving thereto what they will. So you have dealt in this Argument unfaithfully with Authors, uncharitably, falſely, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably with the Churches of God; and all moſt apparently to effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it when you have done.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, Though I finde it not in expreſs terms in your writing, yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is that you aim at, when you tell us the <hi>King on his death-bed gave it to the Prieſts that then were:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That's not ſo, <hi>Deo &amp; Eccleſiae</hi> do the uſual Grants run, to God and the Church. The errors were perſonal, and die with the perſon; the next being free from his Predeceſſors fault, will not be liable to his puniſhment: Yet a ſober adverſary will not ſay that all the Miniſters, even in communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> when Tithes were firſt given, were Papiſts; yet if they were, ſuppoſe a gift be given to the Church of <hi>Staplehurſt,</hi> and let the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> this mans hereſie will not make the next Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98432:50"/>
a ſound Orthodox Teacher, uncabable of the gift; for the gift was to the Church, and the errour was the mans. So is it here.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the giver intended this gift that <hi>Arianiſm</hi> and <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> ſhould be ſown among Goſpel-truths, as tares among wheat. The caſe does not appear to be ſo here; but admit it, ſhall the whole grant be void becauſe ſome one uſe of it is found unlawful? why then God hath blotted theſe had uſes out of the deed, the reſt remain, and as much need there is the gift ſhould remain, to carry on the ſtill continuing uſes as ever, when they were all ſuppoſed good: Yea, it may charitably be ſuppoſed, that thoſe very devout Donors, if they lived now, would blot out ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſes with their own hands, if they ſhould know them diſpleaſing to God, who therefore put them in becauſe they thought them pleaſing. If this will not ſerve mens turn, but the deed, becauſe of ſome uſes impoſſible to be fulfilled, appearing now unlawful, is to be accounted void as to all the reſt, It will then return into the hand of Kings and Princes again (to the preſent Landlords and Tenants it cannot, whoſe it never was) and they have confirm'd it by ſeveral Acts ſince the dayes of Reformation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reformed Miniſters, as ſuch, what was at firſt given to <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> as ſuch (if yet it were ſo.) So if this be a flaw, it is made by thoſe, who, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men on earth, have power to heal it.</p>
               <p>And yet I doubt not but as great matters as can be found in thoſe deeds of gift we ſpeak of, will be found as well in moſt ancient conveyances, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of publick charitie; either <hi>Popiſh</hi> reaſons of the Dedication (<hi>pro remiſſione animarum,</hi> as well elſewhere as here) or <hi>Popiſh</hi> uſes of the thing dedicated: Yea, in moſt old Wills of any that died any thing wealthy, we ſhall finde ſomething that favour'd of the ignorant devotion of thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious times. And why ſhould this be an Exception againſt our Tenure only, which is againſt no mans elſe, would be enquir'd into; unleſs this be it, that Miniſters of all men are the only fit perſons to be made a prey of, who have more reaſon to defend themſelvs againſt this plea, then any ſort of perſons whatſoever under the ſame condition, in that thoſe gifts deſigned in part to ſuch unlawful uſes, were given to God and his Chuch, not to the perſon of any man: Now, though what is given to God for unlawful uſes, may, and muſt be taken from thoſe uſes, and applied to other;<note place="margin">

Therefore pray remember, that all errour about Gods Truths is ſinful, the knowledge of the truth being as well commanded us, as obedience to it; and thoſe errours are moſt eſpecially ſinful, which are about matters of practice; for they neceſſarily defile the whole man, and annoy others: And of theſe, if any more then others, they that cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſinews of ſocietie which unite men into bodies together; ſuch as make us prey upon one anothers goods, unfaithfully break ſerious and frequent promiſes, and then ſay all manner of evil falſly of thoſe we have thus injur'd; diſdain them if they be younger then our ſelves; requite great tenderneſs with higheſt contumely, and mock that patience that would fain live at peace with us, put what we Pleaſe into their mouths to make them ridiculous; proclame words well meant, neceſſarily ſpoken, if but liable to any miſconſtruction, concealing what would clear the ſuſpicion, to make them odious; reſolve after all to have nothing to doe with them, and ſtir up the Saints to doe the like. All this hath your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour been fruitful in unto very unkind practiſes againſt me: lay now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſuch principle of errour, to produce ſuch practiſes towards others, and you will not be fit to be either Elder or member of a Church, nor yet to live in a ſocietie of men.

            <p>THis gives a fair reaſon againſt the morality of a tenth of the tenth, if it was paid to the High Priest, for himſelf alone, &amp; the other Prieſts ſhared with the Levite in the reſt: but in caſe the tenth of tenth was paid to the High Prieſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; his fellow Prieſts; ſo make them ſharers with him, not with the Levites, as is thought by ſome out of <hi>Neh. 10.38.</hi> Then ſomewhat more is to be ſaid, why the tenth of tenth belongs not to our preſent inquiry, as being confeſſedly Ceremonial, whereas the Levites tenth was not. The reaſons of this I humbly conceive, are from the great difference in the Officers under the Law, from the Officers under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in point of,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Number. Then the Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were a ſmall part of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the children of <hi>Levi;</hi> and therefore were well provided for by a tenth out of the tenth: Whereas it is otherwiſe under the Goſpel comparing Biſhops and Deacons together; they began with twelve on one ſide (though we exclude the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty) and ſeven on the other ſide; and in all ages ſo it continued, Deacons fewer then the Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments; a tenth therefore of a tenth cannot be obſerved now.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Service. The difference between the Prieſts ſervice and the Levites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholely Ceremonial; conſequently the difference of maintenance, which in part was grounded on a different ſervice (the Prieſts not being a tenth part of the Levites, though they had a tenth part of their proviſion) muſt be Ceremonial too; if the Prieſt prayed for, and bleſſed the people ſo did the Levite. <hi>Neh. 9.4, 5.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.19.</note> If the Prieſt taught the people out of the Law, ſo did the Levite. <hi>2 Chro. 17.8, 9.</hi> If the Prieſt executed Judgement in matters of the Lord, ſo did the Levite. <hi>2 Chro. 19.8, 11.</hi> Take away Sacrifices and what was annexed to them, and their ſervice are altogether the ſame: but ſo it is not between Biſhop and Deacon under the Goſpel (ſaid in to God) the ſumme is, the Command of a tenth from the people might be moral,<note place="margin">Survey of diſcip. pt. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>31.</hi>
               </note> yet the diſtribution of it) between Prieſts and Levites in part civil, referring to their different numbers; in part Ceremonial, referring to their different ſervices; ſo the Reverend Maſter <hi>Tho. Hookers</hi> concluſion; upon the ſuppoſed morality of a tenth will not follow (Ergo the Miniſters must have the tenth of a Tenth.)</p>
            <p>This foundation removed out of the way; the enforcement of this reaſon added by that excellent holy man falls to the ground with it. It is this (then Miniſters must receive from them happily, who were never taught by them; as the Levites who taught in the particular Synagogues paid to the Prieſt, and to the Levites too, who adminiſtred in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) this is ſuppoſed contrary to <hi>Gal. 6.6.</hi> but indeed is not; for caſes may be where in they that are not taught are bound to contribute to a Teacher as well as they that are: Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> might have obſerved one caſe at home in the Preachers to the convert <hi>Indians;</hi> we are all, both <hi>Englands,</hi> New and Old, their Debtours of an honorable maintenance, though they never Teach us. They that do common ſervice for all (as the Prieſts at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as well as for the reſt of the Jews) deſerve a common proviſion from all. But however to put all out of doubt, as there is no ſuch diſtribution of Offices for the people, as a part of the peoples ſervice to be performed by ſome Officers, where the people live; and a part by other Officers elſewhere; ſo there is not that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of payments: but he that is taught communicates to him that Teaches, and ordinarily to none elſe; none elſe being conſtantly attending to ſerve him elſe where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
